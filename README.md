# Unity-Projects
 This repo contains exclusively Unity game projects.
 
## Project Intentions:
  This repo is intended to showcase my abilities and learning progress with the Unity game engine.

## How can I playtest these games?
  Excellent question! 
   -> Just open the "Builds" folder and downlolad the most recent version (i.e. "v_1.2" vs "v_1.1.8"). 
   -> Extract to your desktop (or wherever you want to store it).
   -> Launch the "(INSERTPROJECTNAMEHERE).exe" and you're set!
